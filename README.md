# addon-phlex
Hass.io integration for Phlex (Plex with google/amazon voice assistant)

The web ui button in Hass.io is not currently functional. To access the phlex UI, go to:
http://[HOST IP]:5123/Phlex

The configuration file is stored in /share/ and symlinked to the Phlex directory in /data/www/localhost/htdocs/
The Phlex directory is symlinked to /var/www/localhost/htdocs/Phlex while I work out some issues with the apache configuration

refer to https://home-assistant.io/hassio/installing_third_party_addons/ for installation instructions

Note: I'm no longer maintaining this repo. It might still work, but I can't offer too much support
